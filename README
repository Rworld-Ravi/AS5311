Recommendation:
*Use 5V instead of 3.3V on this chip. When I used 3.3V readings were unstable but 5V readings are very stable.

Features:
*Fastest library available for AS5311 on GitHub.
*Implementation of theoretical three pole system for easy linear distance calculation.
*Dynamic Zeroing feature :P. It will zero the readings and calculate offsets automatically. Very helpful if you are designing a product.
*Arduino microcontrollers supported. Could be easily modified for other microcontrollers like PIC, etc. 


Please let me know if there are issues.
