![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `*` Use 5V instead of 3.3V on this chip. When I used 3.3V readings were unstable but 5V readings are very stable.
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `*` Please choose your magnetic strip carefully. The magnetic strips which were sent by www.digikey.ca along with this chip were not working   properly. I had to order new magnetic strips from a different company and it worked like a charm.

Features:
*Fastest library available for AS5311 on GitHub.
*Implementation of theoretical three pole system for easy linear distance calculation.
*Dynamic Zeroing feature :P. It will zero the readings and calculate offsets automatically. Very helpful if you are designing a product.
*Most Arduino boards are supported. Could be easily modified for other microcontrollers like PIC, etc.

Please let me know if there are issues.
