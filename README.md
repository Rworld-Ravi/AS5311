![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `Recommendations:` <br />
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) Use 5V instead of 3.3V on this chip. When I used 3.3V readings were unstable but 5V readings are very stable. <br />
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) Please choose your magnetic strip carefully. The magnetic strips which were sent by www.digikey.ca along with this chip were not working properly. I had to order new magnetic strips from a different company and it worked like a charm. When chip is mounted correctly and magentic strip is parallel to surface of AS5311 chip at a proper distance you will not get these errors "LIN, INC, DEC, COF, OCF". Please read datasheet for more details. <br />
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) Tested against a highly accurate dial gauge. Accuracy was within +-10 micro-meters.


![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Features:`  <br />
 ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Fastest library available for AS5311 on GitHub.  <br />
![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Implementation of theoretical three pole system for easy linear distance calculation.  <br />
![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Dynamic Zeroing feature :P. It will zero the readings and calculate offsets automatically. Very helpful if you are designing a product.  <br />
![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Most Arduino boards are supported. Could be easily modified for other microcontrollers like PIC, etc.  <br />
